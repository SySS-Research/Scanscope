<h3>Info</h3>
<p>Scanscope presents information from a port scan for humans.

<h4 class="mt-3">The Diagram</h4>
<p>The diagram can look confusing at first glance, so here is some
clarification. Let's go over some important points.
<ul>
<li><b>Host group:</b> All hosts that have the same set of ports open belong
to the same host group. Filtered ports count as closed.
<li><b>Fingerprint:</b> For technical reasons, we assign a set of ports a
fingerprint, which is a hexadecimal number with 32 digits. There is one
special case: The emtpy set, i.e.  a host with no open ports,  is assigned a
<code>NULL</code> value.
<li><b>Color:</b> Each fingerprint is assigned a color to make it easier to
differentiate between host groups. It has no special
meaning. Because there are many fingerprints, colors can be very similar.
This is a known limitation.
<li><b>TCP/UDP ports:</b> For brevity, we leave out the designation TCP/UDP.
Instead, we define positive port numbers as TCP and negative port numbers as
UDP; i.e port <code>-53</code> is <code>53/udp</code>.
<li><b>Coordinates:</b> The coordinates in the 2D diagram are derived by
projecting points in a 2<sup>17</sup> dimensional space onto two dimensions using
algorithms from data science. They have no particular meaning and have a
random component, so the will look different each time you run Scanscope. The aim is
that similar host groups are nearby.
<li><b>Limitations:</b> As usual, firewalls and other network components
between your device and the targeted systems can skew the results. Also, the
more ports you can the better the result. In terms of Nmap arguments,
<code>-p-</code> (i.e. all TCP ports) is best while <code>-F</code> (i.e. the top 100 ports)
should represent a reasonable balance between speed and meaningfulness of
the results.
</ul>
